          <h2>About Cinnamon</h2>
          <p>
            Cinnamon refers to several evergreen trees of the genus Cinnamomum
            native to Sri Lanka, the Malabar Coast, and Myanmar. Dried cinnamon
            bark is a popular spice used in cooking and baking, either in ground
            or stick form. It has a strong, spicy, sweet flavor. Cinnamon
            essential oil also has antibacterial and antifungal properties and
            is used by gardeners to stave off root rot. The most popular
            varieties of cinnamon are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum): Also known as true cinnamon,
              Ceylon cinnamon has a delicate flavor and is often used in Mexican
              dishes like arroz con leche.
            </li>
            <li>
              Vietnamese cinnamon (Cinnamomum loureirii): Also known as Saigon
              cinnamon, this variety of cinnamon from Vietnam has a strong
              flavor and aroma that’s delicious in phở broth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chinese cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia): Sometimes called cassia
              cinnamon, this is the kind of cinnamon most often found in grocery
              stores and is what most people think of when they imagine cinnamon
              sticks.

          <h2 >How to Plant Cinnamon</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re considering cultivating your own cinnamon tree, it’s
            important to keep in mind that cinnamon trees are native to tropical
            regions. Cinnamon plants can only truly thrive as outdoor plants in
            USDA Hardiness Zones 9–11. Otherwise, they’re best kept as
            houseplants, or kept outside only during the warmer months. With
            that in mind, here’s how to plant cinnamon outdoors:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Look for a sunny spot. Plan to plant your cinnamon in spring or
              early fall in a spot that gets full sun (at least twelve hours a
              day). Your cinnamon plot should be at least four feet by four
              feet.
            </li>
            <li>Dig a hole. Dig a one foot by one foot hole in the plot.</li>
            <li>
              Prepare the bed. Fill the hole with a sandy, well-draining loam or
              potting mix with plenty of perlite. Cinnamon favors an acidic soil
              pH between 4.5 and 5.5, so work sphagnum peat moss into the mix if
              necessary to reach the right acidity level.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plant transplants or seeds. If transplanting a young tree from a
              nursery, loosen the root ball, place the tree in the hole, and
              cover with the soil. If growing from cinnamon seeds, fill the hole
              first and bury the seeds half an inch below the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fertilize the bed. If transplanting, apply a slow-release
              fertilizer or layer of compost near the base of the plant. This is
              called side-dressing. You can skip this step and fertilize later
              if planting from seed.

          <h2>3 Tips for Planting Cinnamon in Containers</h2>
          <p>
            If you plan to grow your cinnamon in a pot, you’ll need to take
            special precautions:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Choose a large pot with drainage holes. Make sure to use a pot
              with sufficient drainage holes and with enough space—one that
              measures at least twenty-four inches by twenty inches.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add mesh if needed. You may need to cover the pot’s drainage holes
              with mesh to keep the loose soil from falling out.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find a south-facing location. Place the pot in an area of your
              home that gets plenty of light, ideally by a window that faces
              south for maximum exposure.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

          <h2>How to Grow Cinnamon</h2>
          <p>
            Since cinnamon is a tropical plant, it requires plenty of moisture
            and very warm temperatures to thrive:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Keep the soil moist. Every spring, apply plenty of mulch to the
              base of your cinnamon tree. Mulch helps retain moisture and heat.
              Water your cinnamon plant as needed, checking a few inches under
              the surface to see if the soil is dried out. If growing your
              cinnamon plant indoors, mist it regularly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Protect it from the cold. Bring your cinnamon tree inside if the
              outdoor temperature drops below 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Watch for pests and diseases. Keep an eye out for damaged branches
              or leaves and prune if necessary. Inspect the leaves of your
              cinnamon tree from time to time for mealybug or leaf miner damage,
              applying organic insecticide as needed.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>How to Harvest Cinnamon</h2>
          <p>
            Give your cinnamon tree two to three years after planting to fully
            develop. When the bark is brown and the leaves are firm, the plant
            is ready for harvesting. Carefully follow these steps to harvest its
            inner bark without damaging the tree:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Remove branches. Using large pruners or a saw, either cut off some
              of the tree’s branches or remove its main trunk if you’re ready to
              harvest the entire plant.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut away the outer bark. Cut away the outer bark until you reach
              the yellow-orange inner bark. This is the new growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Peel the inner bark. Peel away strips of the inner bark until you
              reach the core of the branch or trunk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dry the inner bark. Set the peeled pieces in a single layer on a
              window screen or tray. They will curl as they dry until they
              resemble the cinnamon quills you’re used to.
            </li>
            <li>
              Store the cinnamon quills. Your cinnamon is now ready to use and
              will keep for years if stored in a dry, airtight container.
            </li>
          </ol>

      </main>
